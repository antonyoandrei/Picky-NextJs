## Folder Architecture

The frontend follows a modular folder architecture, promoting better organization and scalability. Each component and feature is structured within designated folders, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

## Integration of Auth0

Picky incorporates Auth0 for secure authentication and authorization. Users can log in securely and perform CRUD operations based on their roles and permissions.

## Sending JWT in HTTP Requests

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are utilized to handle user authentication. These tokens are securely sent in HTTP requests to validate user actions, maintaining a secure communication channel between the frontend and backend.

## Proper Use of Types

TypeScript is employed for type safety throughout the frontend codebase. This ensures better code quality and catches potential errors during development.

## Code Modularization

Code is modularized to enhance readability and reusability. Components and functions are organized logically, promoting an efficient and maintainable code structure.

## UX/UI Design

The application's user interface is designed with a focus on user experience. The Figma design provides a visually appealing and intuitive layout, making movie management an enjoyable and straightforward process.

## Deployment on Vercel

The Picky frontend is deployed on Vercel, providing a scalable and efficient hosting solution. Vercel streamlines the deployment process, ensuring that the frontend is readily accessible and performs optimally.
